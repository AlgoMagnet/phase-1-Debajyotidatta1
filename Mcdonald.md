  # Mcdonald's Summary in Points
  - The narrative of The Movie starts from 1954, which shows Kroc giving the brothers the idea to franchise.
  - Dick and Mac had franchised about six restaurants before they met Kroc. Kroc, who supplied the milkshake machines used in their restaurants, was so surprised when they placed an order for eight Multimixers for one restaurant that he flew to California to find out what kind of business could possibly be making so many milkshakes.
  - When Kroc arrived at the restaurant, he saw a huge queue. He also wanted to buy something from the restuarant. So, he also joined the queue. After sometime his order came. He was hugely surprised by the fact the the ordered delivered to him so quick.
  - Kroc—who had previously struggled to make ends meet, taking gigs as a jazz pianist and a paper-cup salesman over the years—immediately asked for the job as McDonald’s franchise agent.
  - He struck a deal with Dick and Mac, agreeing to pay them 0.5% of all future sales. Over the next five years, he created a chain of 228 McDonald’s, in locations specifically selected in suburbs filled with families to whom the company hoped to market. Trying to appeal to kids, the company developed the character of Ronald McDonald to appear on TV ads and in restaurants. By 1960, the restaurants were grossing $56 million annually.
  - Kroc, however, was dissatisfied with his small cut of the profits. He asked the McDonald brothers how much they’d be willing to pay to sell him the whole chain, including its name. 
  - Their price was $2.7 million, with the caveat that they would maintain ownership of their original restaurant. Kroc borrowed from multiple sources in order to meet the price.
  - The sale left Kroc bitterly angry with the McDonald brothers for keeping the original location. He opened a McDonald’s location across the street from the brothers’ original restaurant, forcing them to rename the original burger joint, which didn’t stay in business much longer.
  - Kroc didn't give the 1% Share that he promised the brothers.
