  # Mcdonald's Summary in Points
  - The narrative of The Movie starts from 1954, which shows Kroc giving the brothers the idea to franchise.
  - Dick and Mac had franchised about six restaurants before they met Kroc. Kroc, who supplied the milkshake machines used in their restaurants, was so surprised when they placed an order for eight Multimixers for one restaurant that he flew to California to find out what kind of business could possibly be making so many milkshakes.
  - When Kroc arrived at the restaurant, he saw a huge queue. He also wanted to buy something from the restuarant. So, he also joined the queue. After sometime his order came. He was hugely surprised by the fact the the ordered delivered to him so quick.
