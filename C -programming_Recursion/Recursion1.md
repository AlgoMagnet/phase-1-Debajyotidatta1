# Recursion 1
- A function that calls itself is known as a recursive function. And, this technique is known as recursion.
- Mathematical intuition in recursion comes from mathematical induction.
- In Recursion we have 2 things 
     - ****Base Condition****: In the recursive program, the solution to the base case is provided and the solution of the bigger problem is expressed in terms of smaller problems. 
     - ****Recursive Condition****: The "recursive condition" is the set of circumstances in which the function will call itself recursively to reduce the problem domain. When this happens, a new function call is added to the stack and the call goes "deeper".
- ****Dry-Running Recursive Procedures****
    -  Label the program with line numbers - it will help you keep track of where you are within the program.
    -  Make sure that you understand the way that the elements in the table are referenced.
- Learnt to a problem to print 1 to 5 using Recursion or upto n numbers or printing n numbers in reverse order.
    - by taking into consideration f(n) is actually f(n-1) and n.
- Another problem: Print 1 to 5 and 5 to again return to 1.
