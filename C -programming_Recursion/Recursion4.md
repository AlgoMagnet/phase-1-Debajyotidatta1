- **Tower of Hanoi**
    - The Tower of Hanoi (also called the Tower of Brahma or Lucas' Tower and sometimes pluralized as Towers, or simply pyramid puzzle is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different diameters, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks stacked on one rod in order of decreasing size, the smallest at the top, thus approximating a conical shape.
    - Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules: 

        -  Only one disk can be moved at a time.
        -  Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
        -  No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
