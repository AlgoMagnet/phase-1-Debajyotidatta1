# Recursion 3
- Recursive call
    -  A recursive call is one where procedure A calls itself or calls procedure B which then calls procedure A again. 
- Another intuition: f(x,n)= f(x,n-1)*x  for solving a specific type of problem.
- Euler Tour of Tree
   - A Tree is a generalization of connected graph where it has N nodes that will have exactly N-1 edges, i.e one edge between every pair of vertices.
